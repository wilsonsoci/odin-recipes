    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F)</li>
        <li>In a large bowl whisk together the flour, salt and baking soda to combine and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl cut the butter into small pieces and microwave until melted. Do not let the butter become hot. If it does, wait 10 minutes before making the cookies.</li>
        <li>To the melted butter add the brown sugar, granulated sugar, and vanilla and mix until combined and emulsified. Whisk in your egg until completely incorporated.</li>
        <li>Using a spatula combine the flour mixture with the butter mixture and mix until the dough is well combined and there are no more visible spots of flour.</li>
        <li>Stir in chocolate and using a large ice cream scoop, spoon 8 balls of dough onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Leave enough space between each cookie as these cookies will spread out in the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake it for about 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Allow the cookies to sit on the cookie sheet for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy it!</li>
    </ol>
